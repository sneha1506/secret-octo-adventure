This code substitutes the characters of a string

word_substitution.py:-

@ Author: SNEHA GUNDA

This code substitutes the characters of a string 
(a with[4 and @]) (and with &) (e with 3) (f with ph) (i with !) (o with 0) (s with[5 and $]) (t with [7 and +]) each of the substitutions are performed separately and
returns an array that contains the results of each substitution.

How to run the file:-

Run the word_substitution.py file using the command “python word_substitution.py” 

It requires the wordlist.txt as input file and then it creates the output file "wordlist-substituted.txt" in your current working directory.
I have also included output file "wordlist-substituted.txt" in the zip file.
